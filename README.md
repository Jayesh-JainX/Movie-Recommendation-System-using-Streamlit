## Project Overview

This Movie Recommendation System allows users to discover new movies based on their preferences. Built with Streamlit, this application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore movie recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- MovieLens Dataset (or any other dataset)

## Features

- **User Input:** Users can input their favorite genres, movies, or keywords.
- **Recommendation Algorithm:** Utilizes collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to generate recommendations.
- **Visualizations:** Displays various charts and graphs related to movie statistics.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for specific movies in the recommendations.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

To get started with the Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Streamlit.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Streamlit
   ```

2. Ensure you have Streamlit installed. If not, install it:

   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

## Usage

Before running the Streamlit application, execute the following Jupyter Notebook to create the necessary similarity model:

1. Run Main.ipynb to generate the similarity.pkl file.

2. Then, to run the application, use the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

### How It Works

1. Data Loading: The application loads a dataset (like MovieLens) containing movie titles, genres, and ratings.
2. User Input Processing: Users can input their preferences through the interface.
3. Recommendation Generation: The system processes user input and applies the chosen recommendation algorithm to suggest movies.
4. Display Results: Recommended movies are displayed along with relevant details such as ratings, genres, and posters.
